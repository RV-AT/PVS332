CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-250] Generated clock AHB_SPI1/clk_ctrl/CLK has only disabled paths from master clock CLK.
Resolution: Analyze why a timing arc is disabled between the master clock and the generated clock. If this expected, remove the definition of the generated clock because it is not needed by your design. If this is not expected, modify the design or the constraint that is causing the problem.
